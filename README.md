# ScorpionsHaveSixLegs
Arduino code for an autonomous hexapod walking robot, with a flexible grabber attached to the base at rear. Hopefully it will be able to walk around picking up bits of detritus. Would be amazing if possible to solar power - but napkin maths suggests that the solar panel would need to be approx 13m^2.

## Planned features (Phase 1)
- [ ] Read sonar input
- [ ] Control of robotic legs
- [ ] Walk in a simple 4-by-2 insectoidal gait
- [ ] Turning
- [ ] Collision detection and avoidance

## Planned features (Phase 2)
- [ ] Waypointing and routing
- [ ] More complex gaits for different terain
- [ ] Control of robotic arm and grabber
- [ ] Read visual input (may be reduced to colour diferential only for cost/scale purposes)
- [ ] Object targeting
- [ ] Ability to pick up object and return to designated dropoff point
